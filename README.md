# Spec-IDE-Interface
Buffered and Unbuffered 8 bit IDE interfaces for the zx Spectrum.

This is a (Another) remake of the Pera Putnik/Gary Lancaster design for a simple 8-bit IDE interface for the zx Spectrum.

There are two versions of this, and unbuffered version which is basically the same as the PP/GL design except with additional HDD and Power LED pins.

The Buffered one buffers all the lines going to the Hard drive, which should make the interface more reliable for longer cable lengths.
